# CS61B-BYOW
Build your own world project for CS61B: Data Structures


I worked with Juno Lee on this project over the course of 3 weeks in Spring 2021. This was our final project for the class. Our task was to create a playable rougelite game with at least 3 core gameplay mechanics and a randomly generated map. The files we created are under proj3/byow/Core. There is much to be desired with this project in terms of optimization, organization, and overall structure, but it is a good showcase of my programming skills and experience at the time.

A video of the game can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLdciEv1C1M&t=68s
